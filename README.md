Created by Mark Reynolds

## Concept:
Re-create Google and Blue Apron's index pages with html and CSS. 

## Features:
Both the sites are responsive to the screen width making the proper adjustments based on the viewers window.

Blue Apron has a special button called Hulk Mode!

<br />

## Hulk Mode
<img src="blue apron\content\imgs\go-green.png" width="150" height="100" />


By clicking hulk you will active Hulk Mode which does a few special things.
* It uses javascript at the bottom of the html page to change all the colors in all the SVGs to Hulks colors
* It uses CSS variables to change blue aprons theme to hulk
* it uses CSS animations on all a tags
